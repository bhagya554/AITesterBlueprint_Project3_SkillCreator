# LinkedIn Post Generator

## When to use this skill
- User wants to share a professional achievement.
- User is announcing a new job, project, or certification.
- User wants to share industry insights or thought leadership.
- User needs to promote an event, article, or webinar.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Context Gathering
Ask the user for the following details:
```
👔 **LinkedIn Post Context**

Please provide:
1. **Topic**: What is the post about?
2. **Target Audience**: Who are you speaking to? (e.g., Recruiters, Developers, Clients)
3. **Desired Tone**: (e.g., Professional, Inspirational, Casual, Data-driven)
4. **Purpose**: (Achievement, Announcement, Insights, or Promotion)
```

### Step 2: Generation Framework
Apply the **Engagement Stack** to the draft:

#### 1. The Hook (First 2 Lines)
- Must be visible before the "See more" clip.
- Use: A bold statement, a challenging question, or a surprising statistic.

#### 2. The Body (100–200 words)
- **Whitespace**: One sentence per paragraph for readability.
- **Value**: Share the "Why" and "How", not just the "What".
- **Listicles**: Use bullet points for takeaways or key features.

#### 3. The CTA (Call-to-Action)
- Drive conversation: "What are your thoughts on X?" or "Agree? Let's discuss in the comments."
- Direct action: "Link to the full article in the comments."

### Step 3: Refinement Loop
Ask the user:
```
Post drafted! Would you like to:
- **Shorten/Lengthen** the post?
- **Adjust Tone**: "Make it more [casual/professional/assertive]."
- **Add Emojis**: Focus on 💡 ✅ 🚀 📈 🤝.
```

## LinkedIn Formatting Rules
- ❌ No more than 3-5 hashtags at the very bottom.
- ❌ Avoid external links in the main text (LinkedIn algorithm prefers links in first comment).
- ✅ Use symbols for bullets (•, 🔹, ✅).
- ✅ Keep it authentic; avoid "corporate speak" where possible.
